\section{Goal-Setting Component}
\tabulinesep=1.5mm
  \begin{longtabu} to \textwidth {|X|c|X|}
    \hline
      \textbf{Specification}
      & \textbf{Status}
      & \textbf{Notes}
    \endhead \hline
    \gls{gsc} shall provide list of recommended \gls{pa} goals
      & Implemented
      & 
    \\ \hline
    \gls{gsc} shall automatically set the recommended \gls{pa} goal if the user does not explicitly do that 
    & Implemented
    & If the user does not set a goal during the initial-setup, the app sets the recommended daily activity levels
    \\ \hline
    \gls{gsc} shall allow the user to set a Maximum Continuous Inactivity (MCI) before a reminding notification is sent 
    & Implemented
    & 
    \\ \hline

 \section{Monitoring component}
 \tabulinesep=1.5mm
  \begin{longtabu} to \textwidth {|X|c|X|}
    \hline
      \textbf{Specification}
      & \textbf{Status}
      & \textbf{Notes}
    \endhead \hline
    \gls{mc} component shall classify four physical activities
    & Implemented
    & The classifier is trained to recognise \textit{walking}, \textit{running}, \textit{cycling} and \textit{static}
    \\ \hline
    \gls{mc} shall the increment user's \gls{pa} or \gls{st} value whenever physical activity or sedentary behaviour is recognised
    & Implemented
    & 
    \\ \hline
    The \gls{mc} shall personalise \gls{har}'s classifier
    & Not implemented
    & Due to the time constraints of the project this feature was not implemented.
    \\ \hline
    The system shall allow the user to group the collected data in "Daily" and "Weekly" representation
    & Implemented
    & This is implemented in the History screen of the application
    \\ \hline
    The user shall be able to set the \textit{Sleeping Hours Time Interval} (\gls{shti}) during which no measurement of \gls{pa} or \gls{st} should occur
    & Implemented
    & 
    \\ \hline

 \section{Feedback Component}
 \tabulinesep=1.5mm
  \begin{longtabu} to \textwidth {|X|c|X|}
    \hline
      \textbf{Specification}
      & \textbf{Status}
      & \textbf{Notes}
    \endhead \hline
    \gls{fc} shall notify the user when they are being sedentary for 1 hour (or the value set by the user) as recommended by \citet[]{swartz2011}
    & Implemented
    & 
    \\ \hline
    \gls{fc} shall notify the user when a previously set goal is attained (e.g. being active for 30 minutes)
    & Implemented
    & 
    \\ \hline
    \gls{fc} shall not send notifications during the "Sleeping Hours" time interval
    & Implemented
    & 
    \\ \hline
    \gls{fc} shall send a notification to the user every Sunday to show goal-performance feedback for the past week
    & Not Implemented
    & Although good to have, due to time constraints this feature was not implemented.
