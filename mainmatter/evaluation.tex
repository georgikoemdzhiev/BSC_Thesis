\chapter{Evaluation}
The purpose of this chapter is to evaluate how the developed mobile application effective is in respect to applying the behaviour change theory discussed in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Literature-Review}. To examine that, a survey was carried out on several university students. The survey results will be discussed first. In addition, the mobile application will be compared against the initial requirements discussed in chapter  \ref{Chapter:Specification}.
