\chapter{Evaluation}
The purpose of this chapter is to evaluate how the developed mobile application effective is in respect to applying the behaviour change theory discussed in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Literature-Review}. To examine that, a survey was carried out on several university students. The survey results will be discussed first. In addition, the mobile application will be compared against the initial requirements discussed in chapter  \ref{Chapter:Specification}.

\section{Acceptance Testing}
Acceptance testing is a key part of the software development process. It evaluates if the software conforms with the client specified software requirements. Consequently, it is determined if the end-product is capable of performing the specified functionality. The following sub-components of the system will be discussed in terms of Acceptance testing, namely \textit{Goal-Setting Component} (\gls{gsc}), \textit{Monitoring Component} (\gls{mc}) and \textit{Feedback Component} (\gls{fc}).

\subsection{Goal-Setting Component}
All of the 3 specifications for this component were implemented successfully. The list of the implemented requirements can be seen in Appendix \ref{chapter:am-acceptance}.

The first requirement - "\gls{gsc}" shall provide list of recommended \gls{pa} goals - was implemented by utilising an Android framework component called \textit{Dialog} \citep{androiddialogs_2017}. A Dialog window is presented to the user so they can choose their \gls{pa} goal in minutes (e.g. 10, 20, 30, 60).

The second requirement \textit{"\gls{gsc} shall automatically set the recommended \gls{pa} goal if the user does not explicitly do so"} is implemented in the \textit{initial setup} set of screens discussed in section \ref{section:initial-setup-screens}. If the user decides to skip the \textit{initial-setup} screens (which offer options such as setting the \gls{pa}, \gls{mci} as well as the \gls{shti}) default values are set. For example, the \gls{pa} goal is set to 30 minutes, \gls{mci} (or the \gls{st} goal) is set to 60 minutes and the \gls{shti} is set to 8pm to 8am.

\subsection{Monitoring component}
Four out of the five initially set features were fully implemented. The list of the implemented requirements can be seen in Appendix \ref{chapter:am-acceptance}.

First of those features \textit{HAR component shall recognise 4 activities(walking, running, cycling and static)} was implemented by gathering activity data from fellow university students and training a model to recognise the above-mentioned activities.

As far as \textit{\gls{mc} shall increment user's \gls{pa} or \gls{st} value whenever physical activity or sedentary behaviour is recognised} is concerned, this feature was implemented in the \textit{ActivityMonitor} class (see section \ref{section:activity-monitor}).

\textit{The system shall allow the user to group the collected data in "Daily" and "Weekly" representation}. This feature was implemented in the \textit{History} screen of \textit{ActiveMinutes}. The \gls{ui} of this screen includes \textit{DAILY} and \textit{WEEKLY} buttons allowing the user to switch between both representation of the collected data, accordingly.

\textit{The user shall be able to set the \textit{Sleeping Hours Time Interval} (\gls{shti}) during which no measurement of \gls{pa} or \gls{st} should occur} was a feature implemented in the \textit{Settings} screen. The \gls{ui} of this screen provides the user with the option to change their \gls{shti} by tapping on the appropriate menu item and choosing the desirable start and end times.

There were some features of the system that were not implemented since it was determined to be too complex given the project time constrains. One of those feature was \textit{The \gls{mc} shall personalise \gls{har}'s classifier}. It was first discussed in the Design chapter (see section \ref{section:classifier-personal-service}). That implementation was designed as Android \textit{Service} which uses the gathered with time and filtered by the classifier's confidence level (e.g. above 80\% - to filter only the recognised activities with high confidence), combine them with the general data and produce a personalised model to replace the general one. As a result, the recognition accuracy of the classifier could be improved greatly as demonstrated by \citet[376]{arapakis_athanasakos_jose_2010}.

\subsection{Feedback Component}
As far as the \gls{fc} is concerned, a total of 3 features were successfully implemented. One of the initial requirements of the \gls{fc} was not implement due to the project's time constrains. \textit{FeedbackProvider} (see section \ref{section:feedback-provider}) represents the \gls{fc} implementation system-wise. All of the features will be briefly discussed bellow.

\textit{\gls{fc} shall notify the user when they are being sedentary for 1 hour} allows the user to be notified for a prolonged sedentary time. This feature was successfully implemented by utilising Android's \textit{Notification} API. In addition, this API is used to satisfy the second feature as well, namely \textit{\gls{fc} shall notify the user when a previously set goal is attained}. This feature allows the user to be notified when they achieve their daily goal (e.g. 30 minutes of \gls{pa}).

Another feature implemented feature - \textit{\gls{fc} shall not send notifications during the user set "Sleeping Hours" time interval} makes sure that the system stops monitoring user's \gls{pa} and \gls{st} levels when \gls{shti} is triggered. 

Last but not least, \textit{\gls{fc} shall send a notification to the user every Sunday to show goal-performance feedback for the past week} - a feature (or rather screen) which provides more information to the user regarding their goal-performance in comparison the only receiving notifications. Although "good-to-have", this feature was not implemented due to the project's time constrains rather than lack of technical capability.
