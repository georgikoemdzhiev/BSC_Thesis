\chapter{Project Considerations}
This chapter addresses the relevant professional, social, ethical, security and legal issues taken into consideration throughout the project development. 
    
    \section{Professional}
    As a student studying Computing for Graphics and Animations – a course that is accredited by the British Computer Society (BCS) I intend to comply with the BCS Code of Conduct. Especially, point 4 (d) \citep{bcs_2017} - “act with integrity and respect in your professional relationships with all members of BCS…”. Thus, I intend to acknowledge the work of all external software authors used in this work (see Appendix \ref{chapter:third-party-software}).

    \section{Social}
    The proposed application will try to avoid promoting any body image stereotypes by focusing more on encouraging the users to be more active rather than on their body characteristics such as weight and height or BMI (Body Mass Index). In addition, the application will only show what the recommended activity intervals per day are and will not force the users of the application to follow those strictly (some jobs do require seating for extended intervals of time – e.g. Pilots).
    
    \section{Ethical}
    The data collected during the project development such as names of the project participants and their accelerometer sensor data will be stored on disk only for the development purposes of the project. 
    
    \section{Security}
    The mobile application, proposed in this work, will offer an authorisation component to prevent other people accessing personal data such as total minutes of activity/inactivity collected daily. What is more, any relevant or valuable user data will be anonymised to protect individual’s identity.

    
    \section{Legal}
    To prevent any harm done to the user, the mobile application will show a disclaimer (warning) dialog message to inform the user that they should be in a good physical condition (not suffering from diseases that could lead to worsening the condition of the user) before they use the application. In addition, I intend to fully comply with the terms of conditions of any third party software that I intend to use (my main goal is to use primarily Open Source software). As far as the project participant’s data is concerned, I intend to keep the data only for the purposes of this project, and the data will not be used for any commercial purpose.
