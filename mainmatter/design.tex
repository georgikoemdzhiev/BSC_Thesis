\label{Chapter:Design}

This chapter discusses the design considerations taken during the design development of the system. The design stage is very important since it lays down the foundation for the whole system. If not done right it could lead to undesired consequences later on in the implementation stage and even in the end-product. \citet[12]{bell2005} states that about 5\% of the total time that takes for the development of a software should be spent for the design state alone. For comparison, the coding takes about 7\% and Testing takes 8\%. Thus a considerable amount of time has been spent in designing the system. 

The design process has gone through many iterations to ensure the best possible quality of the product. The design can be split into two main sections, namely User Interface (UI) Design and System Architecture (SA) design.
