This is my final year project report written in LaTeX. It documents the design and implementation process of ActiveMinutes - an Android application that uses accelerometer sensor to monitor user's activity as well as inactivity levels. 
The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/georgikoemdzhiev/ActiveMinutes">here</a>
