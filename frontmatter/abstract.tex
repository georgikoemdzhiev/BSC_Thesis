\chapter{Abstract}
Sedentary behaviour is a leading cause of numerous chronic deceases, but currently, there is a lack of mobile applications that try to help tackle this problem. The purpose of this paper is to show how behaviour change techniques can be applied in a mobile application to help people change their sedentary habits. This project proposes a smartphone application that uses daily activity guidelines to increase physical activity. This software will be developed based on findings from background research. It will incorporate behaviour change techniques that will allow maintaining a good goal-performance relationship. Also, self-management logic will be present to facilitate self-care features such as setting a psychical activity goal.
