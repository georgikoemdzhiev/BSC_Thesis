\chapter{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Dr Stewart Massie of Robert Gordon University for his guidance during the research and development of the project. \\

\noindent Besides my supervisor, I would like to thank the designers and developers at xDesign for sharing their knowledge and experience with me; my parents Vangel Koemdzhiev and Violeta Koemdzhieva for encouragement me throughout writing this thesis and my partner Mariya Menova for her support and understanding.
